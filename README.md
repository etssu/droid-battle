# Droid Battle

**Droid Battle** is a simple turn-based battle simulation game written in **Java**.  
It is an adaptation of my earlier project, *Battle Arena*, originally implemented in C.

## About a Project

Two droid fight each other using different tools ans stats like health, damage and defense. 
The battle progresses in turns until one of the droid is defeated.

In this project I practiced:
- Object Oriented Programming in Java
- Clean code structure
- Basic game logic and simulation

## Features 
- Object-oriented design using Java classes and inheritance
- Turn-based battle mechanics
- Console-based UI

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Converting logic from procedural (C) to OOP (Java)
- Structuring Java projects
- Debugging and testing battle mechanics
